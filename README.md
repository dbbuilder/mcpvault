1. **Authentication Gateway**: Secure user authentication and session management
2. **Authorization Engine**: Role-based access control with organizational hierarchy support
3. **MCP Registry**: Centralized management of available MCP servers and tools
4. **Key Vault Integration**: Secure secret management across multiple cloud providers
5. **Job Orchestration**: Asynchronous processing with workflow chaining capabilities
6. **Audit and Compliance**: Comprehensive logging and compliance reporting

## Technology Stack Considerations

The platform is designed to support multiple implementation approaches based on specific requirements:

### Option 1: .NET Core (Recommended for Enterprise)
- **Pros**: Excellent Azure integration, mature security ecosystem, strong typing, comprehensive tooling
- **Cons**: Primarily Windows-centric historically (though .NET Core is cross-platform)
- **Use Case**: Organizations heavily invested in Microsoft ecosystem

### Option 2: Rust (Recommended for Performance)
- **Pros**: Memory safety, exceptional performance, growing ecosystem, excellent concurrency
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, smaller talent pool
- **Use Case**: High-performance requirements, security-critical applications

### Option 3: Go (Recommended for Cloud-Native)
- **Pros**: Excellent cloud-native support, simple deployment, good performance, strong concurrency
- **Cons**: Less mature enterprise ecosystem compared to .NET
- **Use Case**: Kubernetes-native deployments, microservices architecture

## Quick Start

  },
  "KeyVault": {
    "Provider": "Azure|AWS|GCP",
    "Configuration": {
      "VaultUrl": "https://your-vault.vault.azure.net/",
      "ClientId": "your-client-id"
    }

    "RequireMFA": true
  }
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Organizations and Hierarchies
MCPVault supports complex organizational structures with teams, roles, and supervisor relationships. Users inherit permissions from their roles and can be granted additional specific permissions.

### MCP Server Management
MCP servers are registered, validated, and version-locked to ensure compliance. Each server undergoes automated security scanning before being made available to users.

### Key Vault Integration
The platform provides an agnostic interface to multiple cloud key vault providers, enabling organizations to use their preferred secret management solution while maintaining consistent access patterns.

### Job Orchestration
Complex workflows can be constructed by chaining multiple MCP server calls, with each step receiving the output of the previous step while maintaining full audit trails.

## Security Model

### Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates with organization credentials
2. System validates against configured identity provider
3. JWT token issued with role-based claims
4. Token includes encrypted key vault access permissions

### Authorization Process
1. Request includes JWT token and target MCP server
2. System validates token and extracts permissions
3. MCP server access permissions checked against user role
4. Required secrets retrieved from appropriate key vault
5. Request proxied to target MCP server with injected credentials

### Audit Trail
Every interaction is logged with:
- User identity and role
- Target MCP server and tool
- Request parameters (sanitized)
- Response metadata
- Key vault operations
- Timestamp and correlation ID
