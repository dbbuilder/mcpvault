- **Server Validation**: Automated security scanning for data leaks, malicious code, and policy violations
- **Server Lifecycle Management**: Deployment, updates, deprecation, and removal workflows with approval chains
- **MCP Veneering**: Dynamic presentation layer that customizes MCP server interfaces per user/role/organization

### 2. Authentication and Authorization
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support for organizations with hierarchical user/role/team structures
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions for MCP servers, tools, and data endpoints
- **Token-Protected Access**: Secure token-based authentication for all MCP server interactions
- **User Impersonation**: Supervisor-level access to subordinate user contexts with full audit trails
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable timeouts and activity logging

### 3. Key Vault Integration
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Agnostic provider interface supporting Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager
- **Encrypted Token Store**: User-specific encrypted token caching with automatic rotation
- **Secret Injection**: Dynamic token injection to destination MCP servers without exposure
- **Key Metadata Tracking**: Database tracking of key types and vault locations (excluding actual keys/values)
- **Access Auditing**: Full audit trail of key vault access and usage for compliance reporting

### 4. Compliance Maintenance Framework
- **Inherited Compliance Posture**: Operates within and maintains your existing compliance certifications
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated enforcement of organizational policies and access controls
- **Audit Trail Generation**: Comprehensive, tamper-evident logging for compliance audits
- **Data Governance**: Ensures MCP operations align with existing data classification and handling policies
- **Change Management**: Controlled deployment processes that maintain compliance during updates
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerting for policy violations or anomalous behavior

### 5. Job Management and Orchestration
- **Asynchronous Job Queue**: Persistent job queue with status tracking and recovery
- **MCP Chaining**: Multi-step workflow orchestration across multiple MCP servers
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for long-running operations
- **Job Persistence**: Resumable jobs with state preservation across system restarts
- **Notification System**: Configurable notifications for job completion, failures, and status changes

### 6. Data Architecture
- **PostgreSQL Backend**: Primary database for all organizational, user, and system metadata
- **Organizational Hierarchy**: Support for complex org/role/user/team/supervisor structures
- **MCP Server Metadata**: Comprehensive tracking of MCP servers, tools, and capabilities
- **Data Endpoint Management**: Registry of all data sources and their access patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: System performance and usage analytics

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **High Throughput**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users per organization

- **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation with configurable schedules
- **Access Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious access patterns

### Reliability
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA with automatic failover
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region backup and recovery capabilities
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fault tolerance for external service dependencies
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality during outages

### Compliance
- **Compliance Maintenance**: Flexible architecture to maintain your existing compliance certifications
- **Infrastructure Agnostic**: Runs on your compliant infrastructure, inheriting your security posture
- **Policy Alignment**: Ensures MCP operations align with existing organizational policies
- **Audit Support**: Provides necessary audit trails and controls for compliance reviews
- **Containerized Deployment**: Secure container deployment within your compliance boundary
