## Database Architecture

### Core Schemas
- **auth**: Organizations, users, roles, teams, sessions, permissions
- **mcp**: Server registry, versions, tools, permissions, access control
- **vault**: Key vault providers, secret metadata (no actual secrets), token cache
- **audit**: Comprehensive audit logs, compliance policies, violations
- **jobs**: Job definitions, executions, orchestration, scheduling, queues

### Key Tables
- `auth.organizations` - Multi-tenant root entity with compliance frameworks
- `auth.users` - User accounts with MFA and security features
- `auth.roles` - System and custom roles with JSONB permissions
- `mcp.servers` - MCP server registry with health monitoring
- `mcp.server_permissions` - Granular access control for servers and tools
- `vault.providers` - Multi-cloud key vault integration (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- `vault.secrets` - Secret metadata tracking (NO actual secret values)
- `jobs.job_executions` - Workflow orchestration and progress tracking
- `audit.audit_logs` - Comprehensive audit trail for compliance

### Stored Procedures
- **Authentication**: `upsert_user`, `authenticate_user`, `validate_session`, `logout_user`
- **Authorization**: `get_user_permissions`, `assign_user_role`, `check_user_permission`
- **MCP Management**: `register_server`, `update_server_health`, `get_user_accessible_servers`
- **Access Control**: `grant_server_permission`, `check_user_server_access`
- **Key Vault**: `register_provider`, `register_secret_metadata`
